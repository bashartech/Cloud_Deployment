# Phase 5 Implementation Tasks Creation

## Original Prompt
Create detailed implementation tasks for Phase 5 following the proper sequence: first code the event-driven architecture with Kafka and Dapr, then do local deployment on Minikube, and finally cloud deployment.

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive tasks file `specs/Phase_5/tasks.md` organized in professional sequence:
- Phase 1: Code - Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka and Dapr
- Phase 2: Local Deployment on Minikube with Full Dapr Capabilities
- Phase 3: Cloud Deployment with Full Dapr

## Key Changes Made
- Organized tasks in three main phases with proper dependencies
- Emphasized Full Dapr capabilities (Pub/Sub, State, Bindings, Secrets, Service Invocation)
- Highlighted advanced features (Due Dates & Reminders, Recurring Tasks)
- Created detailed, sequential tasks with proper IDs and checkboxes
- Defined clear file paths for each task
- Established dependencies between phases
- Identified parallel execution opportunities
- Created implementation strategy with MVP scope
- Ensured tasks follow the professional sequence: code first, then local deployment, then cloud deployment
